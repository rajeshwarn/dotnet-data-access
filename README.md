# .NET Data Access
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/eb2nx7g5i0ns4f60?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/velio_ivanov/dotnet-data-access)

.NET Framework 2.0 ORM implementation.  
Based on providers architecture, it has a powerful built-in object fetching with properties and methods mapping, including BuildProvider for building strong type from a given database schema.  
Here is the list of already implemented providers: MSSQL Provider, Oracle Provider, Firebird Provider, MySQL Provider, OLE DB Provider, ODBC Provider.

It has been used more than 3 years as my universal tool to work with databases, before Microsoft issuing Entity Framework.  
Looking back to it, I think, it's worth to give it a second live and issue a modern version.
