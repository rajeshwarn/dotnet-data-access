# .NET Data Access

.NET ORM implementation with build in object fetching with properties and methods mapping, including BuildProvider for building strong type from a given database schema.
This is porting of an old project of mine - ORM implementation for .NET Framework 2. Looking back to it, I think, that's worth to give it a second live and issue a modern version.

Based on providers architecture, it has a powerful ORM implemented with built-in object fetching with properties and methods mapping, including BuildProvider for building strong type from a given database schema.  
Here is the list of already implemented providers: MSSQL Provider, Oracle Provider, Firebird Provider, MySQL Provider, OLE DB Provider, ODBC Provider.

It has been used more than 3 years as my universal tool to work with databases, before Microsoft issuing Entity Framework.
